# sign_detection

This project aims in detecting whether a person is using sign language or not in a live stream.
Here I have created my own dataset.

Dependencies:
  * Python 3.x
  * TensorFlow 2.x
  * Numpy
  * OpenCV

I have used Tensorflow, Keras to build CNN model to classify whether a person is signing or not.
Using that model I have created a website to check whether a person is signing or not.
For this I have used streamlit framework.
